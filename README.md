https://modrinth.com/mod/players-burn-in-sunlight

Fabric mod that causes all players to burn in sunlight, like zombies, skeletons, drowned, etc do, from times 23460-12542. Players don't burn in water, rain, snow, or powdered snow, but no distinction is made for wearing helmets (that would be too easy). Fire resistance and fire protection still work. May not show burning effect in creative mode.

Only to be installed server-side.
